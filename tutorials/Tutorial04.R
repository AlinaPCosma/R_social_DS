# Exercise 1
# Change our vector from Tutorial03 to reflect the actual counts
# First, let's store the result of tabulation for later re-use
# Start from exploring the structure of this object with str()
# What are the 2 main parts of this object? How are they stored?
# Extract the relevant parts from the stored object
# Save them as a named vector with provinces as names and counts as values
# Use rev() function to sort the vector in a decreasing order (from largest to smallest)
# Convert the original provinces vector into a factor with the levels ordered accordingly
# Re-run table(provinces)
